* What we will cover (Demo outline)
- Initial deployment
	v1.0 - 1 instance
- Scaling up
	v1.0 - 3 instances - decided per service
- Upgrade to v1.1
	i.e. dotnet 1.0 to 1.1
	Extra info in the v1.1 responses
	Demo local curl call
	Build and push to Dockerhub
- Rollback to v1.0



* What we will cover (Demo outline)
- Fix and build v1.2
- Show history
- Service VIP



* What we will cover (Demo preparation)
- minikube
- minikube dashboard
# minikube dashboard
# minikube proxy - Can now browse the API



* Demo
	# Initial deployment
	cd ./k8s
	kubectl apply -f k8s-simple.yaml --record

	# Start curl loop
	svc_base_url=$(minikube service webapi --url)
	while [[ true ]]; do curl -w '\n' ${svc_base_url}/environment ; sleep 1s; done

	# Scale up - edit and set replicas to 3
	kubectl apply -f k8s-simple.yaml --record

	# Upgrade to v1.1 - edit and set image tag
	kubectl apply -f k8s-simple.yaml --record

	# Oh no, rollback
	kubectl rollout undo deployment/webapi

	# Fix and move to 1.2 - edit and set image tag
	kubectl apply -f k8s-simple.yaml --record

	# Show history
	kubectl history webapi
